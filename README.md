# Digital-Wellbeing

This project aims to bring the digital wellbeing and screen time management features, similar to those found in Samsung Android phones, to Linux operating systems. The project is primarily built using HTML, JavaScript, and Python, with additional programming in Shell and CSS.

## Features

1. Screen Time Monitoring: Keep track of the time you spend on your Linux device and monitor your daily usage patterns. 
2. App Usage Statistics: Get detailed insights into the apps you use the most and how much time you spend on each app.
3. App Limits: Set limits on the usage of specific applications to encourage a healthy balance between screen time and other activities. 
4. Usage History: View your historical data to track your progress and make informed decisions about your digital habits.
5. User Profiles: Create individual profiles for different users to personalize their digital wellbeing settings.
